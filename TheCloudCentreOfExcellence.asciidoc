== Building a Cloud Centre of Excellence

The cloud has revolutionized the way businesses operate, providing access to an abundance of resources and the ability to scale rapidly in response to changing demands. A Cloud Centre of Excellence (CCoE) is a central hub for cloud-related expertise, processes, and knowledge within an organization. This chapter will explore the importance of a CCoE and how to establish one within your organization.

It’s essential that organizations have a centralized unit to manage cloud adoption and full utilization. A CCoE is an essential resource for organizations looking to optimize their cloud investments, reduce costs, and stay ahead of the competition. A CCoE ensures that cloud-related activities are executed consistently and securely across the organization, reducing the risk of cloud-related incidents.

=== Remit of a Cloud Centre of Excellence

Building a CCoE requires a dedicated team of experts who understand the organization’s cloud strategy and the tools, processes, and best practices that need to be in place to support it. A CCoE should be structured to deliver the following:

- *Cloud governance*: Implementing policies and procedures that ensure cloud utilization is consistent, secure, and compliant with industry regulations.

- *Cloud architecture*: Ensuring that cloud infrastructure is designed and deployed to meet the needs of the organization and is scalable, secure, and cost-effective.

- *Cloud operations*: Providing ongoing support and maintenance for cloud infrastructure, ensuring that the organization is always up-to-date with the latest cloud technology.

- *Cloud education and training*: Providing ongoing training and education for staff to ensure they have the skills and knowledge to effectively utilize cloud resources.

- *Cloud innovation*: Encouraging and promoting cloud-related innovation within the organization, leveraging the cloud to drive business growth and success.

=== Strategic Vision

Creating a Cloud Centre of Excellence (CoE) is a significant undertaking and it is crucial to ensure that its delivery is aligned with the strategic themes and vision of the business. The CoE should not just be an IT initiative, but should be aligned with the overall business goals and priorities, and therefore have representation from across the business.

One way to ensure this alignment is to regularly review the strategic themes of the business and assess the CoE’s progress towards those themes. This will allow the CoE to make any necessary adjustments to ensure it is delivering value in line with the business’s priorities. Additionally, the CoE should consider the “bang for buck” when choosing what to undertake, ensuring that its efforts are focused on delivering the most value in the shortest amount of time.

=== Idea Portal

Collecting Ideas from customers, team members, and the business is crucial in driving innovation and continuous improvement within an organization. An Ideas Portal serves as a centralized platform where anyone can submit their suggestions and proposals, creating a collaborative environment that fosters creativity and encourages participation. The importance of collecting ideas lies in the fact that it provides a direct line of communication between the business and its stakeholders, enabling teams to understand the needs and desires of their customers and act upon them in a timely manner. By regularly reviewing and prioritizing the ideas submitted, the organization can quickly identify new trends, areas for improvement and opportunities for growth. By encouraging the sharing of ideas and suggestions, the organization can foster a culture of innovation and drive continuous improvement, leading to better outcomes and customer satisfaction.

=== Portfolio Management

Portfolio management is an important aspect for the Centre of Excellence to consider as it ensures that the work being done aligns with the overall strategic themes of the business. It's crucial to assess the impact vs cost of each project in the portfolio to determine which initiatives will deliver the most value to the company. This helps to organize work into a portfolio roadmap that outlines the priorities and helps to keep everyone focused on the bigger picture. It's important to regularly review the portfolio and make adjustments as needed, taking into account changes in the business environment and market conditions. This way, the Centre of Excellence can ensure that it continues to deliver the maximum value to the business.

=== Architecture & Standards

The Architecture & Standards group plays a helps ensure the success of the agile delivery squads. By creating a framework, blueprints, re-usable templates, and standards, the team can help the delivery squads deliver high-value, high-quality solutions at a high-cadence. This is important because the Architecture & Standards group can be the difference between teams being able to quickly and efficiently get solutions to production or being bogged down by the barriers of adhering to strict standards. By taking a facilitative approach, the Architecture & Standards group can empower teams to quickly deliver value to the business while still ensuring that the solutions are of high quality and meet all necessary requirements. By focusing on enabling teams to deliver value to the business, the Architecture & Standards group can help the company achieve its strategic vision.

=== Communities of Practice

The CoE should be responsible for creating Communities of Practice (CoP) around topics such as AI, low-code, blockchain, automation, testing, DevOps, and agile. These CoPs should bring together experts from across the squads and organization to share knowledge and best practices.

=== Innovation Squad

An innovation squad is a vital part of a cloud center of excellence, as it focuses on the development of new and innovative solutions. Using the principles of lean startup, the squad tests and validates an epic hypothesis before large-scale investment of time and resources is made. This approach enables the team to fail fast and avoid costly mistakes, while also giving the business the opportunity to quickly pivot and refine its strategy. By proving or disproving the hypothesis in a controlled and measured way, the innovation squad ensures that the center of excellence is aligned with the strategic themes of the business and is delivering value in an efficient and effective manner.

=== Agile Delivery Squads

The agile delivery squads are an integral part of the cloud center of excellence. They are responsible for delivering high-value, high-quality solutions at a high-cadence, from an idea through to production. This is achieved by going through the iterative DevOps lifecycle of Prep, Design, Engineer, Test, and Operate. The teams are composed of individuals with specialized roles associated with each of these stages, allowing them to deliver features during each sprint. This autonomous delivery model enables the teams to be efficient and effective in delivering solutions that align with the strategic themes of the business. By having a clear understanding of their role and the stages involved in the delivery process, the teams are able to focus on delivering value to the customer.

=== Continuous Improvement

A critical aspect of any cloud center of excellence is continuous improvement. The CoE should strive to make small, iterative changes to people, process, and technology in order to drive positive change. This approach, known as Kaizen, is a key component of effective organizational change. However, it's also important to have a clear understanding of what "good" looks like. Defining what success looks like allows the CoE to measure progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust their approach as needed. By combining a focus on continuous improvement with a clear definition of success, the CoE can ensure that their efforts are aligned with the overall strategic vision of the organization and deliver value that is aligned with the company's goals and priorities.

=== Performance of the CCoE

The CoE should also use metrics to measure its performance, including State of DevOps metrics to track the speed and efficiency of the delivery process. However, it is equally important to consider team happiness when making decisions, as a happy team is more likely to deliver value to the customers, leading to a higher customer Net Promoter Score (NPS).

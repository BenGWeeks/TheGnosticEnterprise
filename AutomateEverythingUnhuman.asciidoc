== Automate Everything Unhuman

> Or, Automating the Mundane: Freeing up Time for What Matters

Have you ever had to do a task that felt so repetitive and boring that you just wanted to pull your hair out? Well, guess what? Machines are way better at doing those tasks than we are! And it’s time to embrace it.

The truth is, there are plenty of tasks that we do every day that machines can do better and faster. And the great thing is, they don’t get tired, they don’t need breaks, and they don’t make mistakes (unless we program them to). So, why not automate as much as we can?

It’s not just about freeing up time so we can focus on more important tasks. It’s also about creating greater value for the business. Automating processes leads to increased efficiency, reduced errors, and improved decision making. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.

But it’s not just about automating. It’s about hiring the right people to do the job. Don’t just hire more managers, hire doers. People who can create automations and provide the business with greater value.

So, let’s get started. Automate everything that’s unhuman. Let the machines do what they do best, and let us focus on what we do best. Let’s create a future where we can all thrive and succeed together.

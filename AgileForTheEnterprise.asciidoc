== Understanding Agile for the Enterprise: Key Principles and Practices

Agile is a project management and product development framework that has revolutionized the way organizations approach software development, product design, and business operations. The Agile methodology is based on a set of principles that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement over rigid planning and bureaucratic processes. In this chapter, we will explore the key principles and practices of Agile, and how they can be applied to organizations of all sizes and industries.

=== Key Principles of Agile

Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
These principles form the foundation of the Agile methodology, and they prioritize the importance of people and communication over bureaucratic processes and documentation. By focusing on individuals and interactions, organizations can foster a culture of collaboration and teamwork, and create products that are designed to meet the needs of customers and stakeholders.

=== Agile Practices

Scrum: A popular Agile framework that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

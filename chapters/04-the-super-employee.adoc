== The Rise of the "Super Employee": Augmenting Human Intelligence with Technology and AI

We've established the philosophical foundation with philosopher leaders and the structural approach with agile squads. Now we come to the heart of the gnostic enterprise: the transformation of individual human capability through technology. The traditional workplace is undergoing a transformation. With the rise of technology and artificial intelligence, employees are no longer limited to the information and resources available at their fingertips. Instead, employees are becoming "super-employees," augmenting their intelligence and abilities with technology and AI.

So, what does a super-employee look like? A super-employee leverages technology and AI to make better decisions, work faster and more efficiently, and provide better outcomes for their organizations. They have the knowledge and skills to effectively use technology and AI to automate tasks, analyze data, and solve complex problems.

To become a super-employee, there are a few key skills and competencies that employees should focus on:

- *Digital literacy*: understanding how to use technology and AI to work smarter and more efficiently.
- *Data analysis*: using data to make informed decisions and drive outcomes.
- *Continuous learning*: staying up-to-date with the latest technology and trends, and continuously improving skills and competencies.
Organizations also play a critical role in enabling super-employees. By providing employees with the tools and resources they need to succeed, and encouraging a culture of continuous learning and development, organizations can foster a workforce of super-employees who are better equipped to drive high-value outcomes.

With respect to adaption of “People” (in People, Process and Technology), although the use of temporary staff may be relevant to particular skillsets (such as for projects where a particular skill is only required for that project duration), we do not wish to imply that a high turnover is the appropriate solution. This would constitute a “brain drain” that would be detrimental to the company. Rather, the appropriate solution is to ensure that the people within the company are relevantly trained, collaboration facilitated between them, processes optimised, and technology available to augment their skillset. Bring in the rise of the “super employee”.

The “super employees” are augmented and able to add increased value to the company over an extended period in comparison to the competition. They are augmented (such as through the use of Artificial Intelligence, AI) by being able to work more effectively in teams with improved collaboration abilities, automation of menial tasks, improved insights to make better decisions and tools to allow value to the business to be delivered quicker and easier. With the reduction of menial tasks through automation this will also help provide meaningful work for the individual.

Consider taking a quiz without any devices, you might not know or be able to recall correctly all the answers. Now take the test but with your mobile phone where you have access to search the world wide web for answers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have a combined 1.2 million terabytes of data at your disposal). I’m pretty sure you’d do better in the second test. This isn’t cheating, this is augmenting ourselves, improving our intelligence, just from the outside of the skull (for now). How many things did you have to try and remember for exams at school that can be looked up in a few seconds? Something to consider is the importance of teaching kids how to approach problem solving, collaborating and critical thinking, rather than simply “fact recalling”. In the work place the former is more important than the latter.

There are many aspects to intelligence that can be augmented of which IQ is just a slice. Gardner has identified the following intelligences: Verbal/Linguistic, Logical/Mathematical, Visual/Spatial, Bodily/Kinesthetic, Musical, Intrapersonal, Interpersonal and Naturalist. 

If we therefore consider that Process and Technology are about essentially the way through which we augment our People, when optimising our businesses, we should consider the People who are central to the enterprise at the outset of any business change.

In short, the rise of the super-employee is a reflection of the changing workplace. With the power of technology and AI, employees are becoming more intelligent, more productive, and more valuable to their organizations. By embracing this transformation, organizations can harness the power of knowledge and innovation to drive better outcomes for employees and customers alike.

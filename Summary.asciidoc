In this book, we have explored the various ways in which technology and AI can augment human intelligence, making us better equipped to tackle the challenges of the modern business landscape. We have seen how the rise of low-code platforms and cloud technologies, as well as the importance of continuous learning and improvement, are helping employees to become super-employees.

At the same time, we have emphasized the importance of the individual, and how it is essential for employees to strive to provide value to their organizations, rather than be an unreasonable burden. The power of measurement has been discussed, and the need for organizations to develop the skills necessary to effectively inspect and analyze data to drive better outcomes.

We have also discussed the return to chaos, and how organizations that get too big will inevitably fail, and need to organize themselves into small, agile squads of 6 to 10 people. Finally, we have touched on the importance of driving employee and customer happiness, which has been shown to be closely linked, with happy employees leading to happy customers.

It's worth mentioning that this book has been written with the assistance of AI, including ChatGPT, which was used to write the majority of the book in a single evening! The images, including the front cover, were created using MidJourney. This showcases how technology and AI can be used to augment the individual and increase their ability to achieve more in less time. In conclusion, this book serves as a testament to the power of the individual and the role technology and AI can play in empowering them.
